# mytetrisclones
A collection of Tetris games implemented in different programming languages and frameworks. I've heard Tetris referred to as the "Hello World" of game programming. This repository is meant to show examples of Tetris. So far it contains a version in C# and [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net) and C++ and [Allegro 5](https://liballeg.org/).

### Building
Building depends largly on the project. The C# and C++ versions work in Visual Studio 2017. It's also possible to compile allegro on Linux although I've never tried.

### Contribute
If you would like to contribute a version of Tetris in a language or framework not currently listed, or have a different implementation, pull requests are welcome. Thanks!
